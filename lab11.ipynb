    "Welcome to this computational mathematics practical class notebook! Today, we will explore how Julia can be used to solve ordinary differential equations in the context of robotics. Our example model—a simple *double integrator*—can represent the dynamics of a robot moving along a straight line. We will use DifferentialEquations.jl along with several ODE solvers and compare their performance and behavior.\n",
